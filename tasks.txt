DONE:
0. How to check given living time for auction?
1. Connect server + clients via SignalR
2. Create website - when client opens it, generate new auction (set auction time on server to let's say 150ms) and send information to all connected clients via SignalR
3. Send bid from client
4. End auction on server and send information who wins + maybe messages to other with info why loss

TODO:
5. Send ad to website
6. Remember - second price win
