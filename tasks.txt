DONE:
0. How to check given living time for auction?
1. Connect server + clients via SignalR
2. Create website - when client opens it, generate new auction (set auction time on server to let's say 150ms) and send information to all connected clients via SignalR
3. Send bid from client
4. End auction on server and send information who wins + maybe messages to other with info why loss
5. Send ad to website - how to choose different ads on different runs of DSP?
6. Remember - second price win
7. Logger class (SSP, DSP) - Console.WriteLine will do the job
8. Set random in DSP
10. Custom class 'infoWinLose' (win/lose, winning bid, info why lose)
11. After run DSP, execute "getValidAuctions" on SSP
12. WebAPI - GET /Auctions - execute in browser and get plain json contains list of all auctions
13. Add in Auction class property "WinningBid" - internal set
14. Check whether bid arrived to late (Auction.IsValid -> false)

TODO:
9. DSP reconnect?
