DONE:
1. Connect server + clients via SignalR

TODO:
0. How to check given living time for auction?
2. Create website - when client opens it, generate new auction (set auction time on server to let's say 150ms) and send information to all connected clients via SignalR
3. Send bid from client -- POST /api/bids
4. End auction on server and send information who wins + maybe messages to other with info why loss
5. Send ad to website
6. Remember - second price win
